This project is a complete pixel-perfect implementation of a Token Trading Table inspired by Axiom Trade’s discovery dashboard. The entire application is built from scratch using the Next.js 14 App Router along with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS to ensure both strong type safety and complete responsiveness. The main objective of this project is to replicate the UI and user experience of a professional crypto-token table, including real-time price updates, smooth transitions, skeleton loading states, and fully interactive components such as modals, tooltips, sort actions, and column switching. The architecture emphasizes reusable atomic components, clean separation of concerns, Redux Toolkit for complex shared state, and React Query for server communication and caching simulation.

The interface loads with a carefully designed shimmer-based skeleton screen that mimics the layout of the final token table. This ensures that the user experiences almost no layout shift and gets the feel of a polished production UI. Once the data becomes available, it is rendered within a token table grid that displays all required columns such as token pairs, final stretch prices, movement indicators, migrated tokens, and more. Each row is implemented using memoized components so that interactions like hovering, sorting, or real-time updates never cause unnecessary re-renders. This dramatically improves performance and ensures that interaction latency stays below 100 milliseconds, matching the evaluation criteria of the assignment.

The design layer uses Tailwind CSS extensively to achieve a pixel-perfect match with the reference design. Spacing, typography, shadows, borders, colors, transitions, and responsive rules are implemented with Tailwind utility classes, while custom animations are added for smooth shimmer, hover highlighting, and row color transitions during live price updates. Radix UI and shadcn/ui components are integrated so that modals, dialogs, popovers, and tooltips appear with accessibility-first behavior and keyboard navigation support. These components are wrapped inside custom abstractions to maintain the atomic architecture of the project and keep the rest of the codebase clean.

Routing is handled by the Next.js App Router, which allows the token table page to load instantly, enables automatic code-splitting, and ensures smooth navigation even if more sections are added later. The server data layer uses React Query to fetch mocked WebSocket-like data repeatedly, simulating live token updates. Each update triggers a soft animation that smoothly transitions the token price from the previous state to the new one, creating the effect of a real trading dashboard without causing layout jumps. Error boundaries and fallback UI components are also implemented to manage potential fetch failures gracefully.

State management relies on Redux Toolkit, which manages complex UI states including sorting preferences, token filters, hover interactions, modal visibility, and selected token details. This allows global UI behavior to remain consistent across all components, and ensures that state transitions are predictable and well-structured. The sorting feature is implemented in a reusable slice that defines ascending, descending, and default behaviors, allowing the user to sort tokens by price, name, or hourly change. The table instantly updates as sort actions are dispatched, and components re-render only when absolutely necessary due to careful memoization.

The design is fully responsive down to a 320-pixel mobile viewport. The layout automatically shifts from a multi-column grid to a stacked card-like UI on smaller screens, ensuring readability while keeping interactions intact. Tailwind’s responsive utilities and CSS grid were used to engineer this adaptive behavior. Auto-layout snapshots are taken to verify that the UI remains visually consistent across different screen sizes. A Lighthouse test confirms that the project maintains excellent performance, accessibility, SEO, and best coding practices, achieving the score criteria required for submission.

A dedicated YouTube demonstration video accompanies the project and walks through the entire application, showcasing loading screens, live token updates, sorting interactions, modal navigation, and responsive layout changes. The project is deployed on Vercel, ensuring fast load times with server-side optimizations provided by Next.js.

The codebase follows atomic design principles where every UI piece is divided into atoms, molecules, and organisms. For instance, basic typography components, icons, and avatars are atoms, while token rows and modal structures are molecules. The entire trading table functions as an organism composed of smaller reusable pieces. This architectural choice ensures that the project scales without clutter and makes adding new token categories or UI sections trivial. Shared utilities such as currency formatters, WebSocket mock simulators, reusable hooks, and transition helpers are housed within a utilities folder to encourage code reuse and maintainability.

The GitHub repository is organized with clean commits and descriptive messages. Each step of the development process—from component creation to styling revisions to Redux slice additions—is documented through incremental commits for easy review. A detailed README ensures that developers cloning the repository can understand the project structure and run the application locally with minimal setup. This complete implementation demonstrates the ability to build a production-quality, pixel-perfect, high-performance dashboard using industry standard tools and modern frontend architecture.
